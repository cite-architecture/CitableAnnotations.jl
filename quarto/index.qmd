Work with related citable objects.

 citable 
The `CitableAnnotationSet` is an abstraction for a citable set of relations among pairs of URNs.  In each pair, one URN is said to *annotate* the other.


Concrete subtypes of `CitableAnnotationSet` implement:

- metadata functions 
- the `CitableTrait` functions (from `CitableBase`)
- the `CexTrait` functions  (from `CitableBase`)
- dozens of Julia's iterator and collection functions (see a partial list in the [documentation for `CitableBase`](https://cite-architecture.github.io/CitableBase.jl/stable/collections2/))
